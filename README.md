# ROS2 TurtleBot3 Wall-Following Project

## Overview
This repository contains the solution to the final project of the course **"ROS2: Basics in 5 Days"** by TheConstruct. The project involves implementing a wall-following behavior for the TurtleBot3 robot, tested in both simulation and real life. 

The robot utilizes ROS2 concepts, including:
- **Publishers**: For controlling the robot's velocity.
- **Subscribers**: To process sensor data.
- **Services**: To initialize and reset behavior.
- **Actions**: For goal-based wall-following tasks.

The goal is to enable the TurtleBot3 to complete a lap in a predefined circuit by following the walls.

## Files and Structure
The repository includes:
- **ROS2 Workspace**: The entire workspace containing the code, launch files, and configuration for the project.
- **Video Demonstration**: A video showcasing the wall-following behavior in real life.
